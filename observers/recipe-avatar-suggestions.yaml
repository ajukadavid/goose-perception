  **IMPORTANT VARIETY & REPETITION RULES:**
  - Do NOT suggest a break, wellness, or time-off unless there is truly no other urgent or actionable context.
  - If the last suggestion was about breaks, wellness, or taking time off, the next suggestion MUST be about something else (e.g., technical, collaboration, learning, celebration, or actionable work).
  - Penalize suggestions that are too similar in theme, wording, or intent to the last 3 suggestions (if available).
  - Rotate through different suggestion types: technical, collaboration, learning, celebration, actionable, and only occasionally wellness.
  - If you cannot find a new actionable or technical suggestion, prefer a celebration or learning tip over repeating wellness/break advice.
  
  Ensure the new suggestion is meaningfully different from the last_suggestion above; do not rephrase the same idea.
  
  Generate the SINGLE MOST TIMELY and contextual suggestion that reflects the {{ personality_name }} personality.
  **IMPORTANT: Use the local time provided above, not UTC. All time references should be in the user's local timezone.**
  
  **PERSONALITY ADAPTATION:** 
  - Adapt your language and suggestions to match the {{ personality_tone }} tone
  - Focus on priorities like: {{ personality_priorities }}
  - Use phrases similar to: {{ personality_phrases }}
  - Maintain the personality consistently

  **OUTPUT FORMAT: Valid JSON only**
  
  Create a JSON object with a "suggestion" field containing the single most timely suggestion message as a string.
  The string should be the complete suggestion message ready for immediate display.
  
  Example JSON format:
  {
    "suggestion": "You've been coding for 90 minutes straight - time for a 5-minute break?"
  }
  
  Save the suggestion to ~/.local/share/goose-perception/AVATAR_MESSAGE.json as valid JSON.
  **Focus on being genuinely helpful - observe real patterns and suggest real value.**
  Only provide a suggestion that is genuinely based on patterns you observe in the provided data.
  If there's insufficient data, provide no suggestion rather than a generic one.
  Do not include any text outside the JSON object - output ONLY valid JSON.  
  Overwrite the file if it already exists.
